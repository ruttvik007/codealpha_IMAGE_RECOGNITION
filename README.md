Image Recognition System
This project is an Image Recognition System developed during my internship at CodeAlpha. It uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification, with a Django backend and an HTML & CSS frontend.

📌 Features
✅ Upload an image for classification
✅ Predicts object categories using a trained CNN model
✅ Simple and interactive web interface
✅ Built using Django for backend processing

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS
Backend: Django (Python)
Model: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, TensorFlow/Keras
